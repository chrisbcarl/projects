            <h1>Who we are:</h1>
            <p>
                IEEE Student Branch at FAU is an organization of dedicated and inspired engineering students who share a common goal. That goal is to grow themselves as professional engineers by growing their knowledge base through classes, bolstering their experience through hands-on training, expanding their network through activity and influencing the community through outreach. Each engineer in IEEE FAU Student Branch has made a strong commitment to help one another grow and develop. Through teamwork and engineering leadership our members will be ready to exceed current standards of engineering excellence and set standards of their own. We desire to brighten the future by fulfilling our potentials and working together to advance the world of technology.
