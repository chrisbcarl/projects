        <p>This past weekend IEEE FAU Student Branch had the  esteemed privilege and honor to attend the 2013 FAU iLEAD conference to celebrate and enforce the ideologies of student leadership and help clubs at FAU reach their goals to perform at their best and to achieve great things.  The conference began at 9:00 AM where professional student leadership speaker T.J. Sullivan. Sullivan’s new book Motivating the Middle has inspired many students across the nation to reevaluate their traditional way of leading to perhaps strengthen their methods by focusing on some parts of their student organizations which may not be receiving the attention they need. Sullivan’s speech was both insightful and motivating and he captured the crowd with tons of excitement and energy while conveying his point aptly and proficiently.</p>
        <p>From graduate student leaders and professors to professionals with many years of leadership experience in the workforce, the many breakout session leaders gave the conference its amazing quality. All sessions were seriously educational and the material taught was truly priceless. Student were given valuable insight into way their organizations can benefit each and every one of their members more directly so that, as leaders, they could achieve their goals. The sessions were focused on just sthat: How can FAU organizations work a little better, in the right ways to have an easier time reaching their goals?</p>
