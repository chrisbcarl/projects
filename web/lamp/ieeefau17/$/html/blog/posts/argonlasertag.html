        <p> One of my favorite games has always been paintball,
        but I often am unable to play because of the high cost
        of the game, and because many of my friends are afraid
        that it might be painful to play. (Which it's not).
        </p>

        <p> To make a game that I can join with all my friends
        and which I can play whenever. I have been working with
        an Arduino Uno microcontroller to create an IR laser
        gun like what is typically found in game rooms.
        </p>

        <p> While it is my hope to use this page to document
        the build of this project, I am still near the beginning
        of the project, and for the time being I will present
        background information and my first steps.
        </p>


        <h3>IR communication</h3>

        <p>Firstly, what is Infrared light?</p>

        <p> Infrared light is the portion of the electromagnetic
        wave spectrum with a longer wavelength than visible light,
        but shorter than microwaves. While. For the most part,
        this band of the electromagnetic spectrum is not visible
        to the unassisted human eye, it is possible for some people
        to see those wavelengths up to 1065nm under controlled
        conditions.
        </p>

        <p>For the rest of us, we need some form of aid to see
        infrared lights, the most well-known is through “night vision”
        goggles. Since I don’t have any specialized equipment, I used
        my phone’s camera to view the infrared from my LEDs. With the
        use of a camera, it is possible for us to see near infrared
        light, which thankfully, is what most IR communication uses.
        You can try this by looking through a phone's camera into the
        transmitter of a remote control as you press a button.
        </p>

        <p>The IR LEDs I will be using have a wavelength of 980nanometers,
        and would fall into the range of what is called near- infrared
        since it is closer to the wavelength of red (780nm) than to a
        microwave (1mm). Note, the boundary between what is near infrared
        and what is far infrared may vary depending on which field you are
        in, or who you talk to.
        </p>

        <h3>How to “communicate” </h3>


        <p> IR is actually a pretty effective way to communicate, it is
        used in households in the form of small appliances like
        television remotes, and is even used in optical fiber
        communication systems.
        </p>

        <p>
        Typically, IR communication is modulated at a 38kHz signal to
        be useful for communication. There is actually a lot of ambient
        infrared in the environment. Anything that produces heat is
        producing infrared light. The sun, light bulbs, and even your
        own body heat are sources of infrared light.
        </p>

        <figure><img src="assets/blog/Thermal_image.jpg" height="250" width="333"><figcaption><center>A thermal image of your hand shown by infrared light</center><figcaption></figcaption></figcaption></figure>

        <p>With modulation, we distinguish between an actual signal, and
        the environment. Now we can use a protocol. I use the NEC
        protocol since it is very well established and used by many
        companies throughout the world, not just in Japan, where it was
        created. IR communication is very similar to how computers
        communicate, everything is a string of 1’s and 0’s.
        </p>

        <p>Logical '0' – a 562.5µs pulse burst followed by a 562.5µs
        space, with a total transmit time of 1.125ms
        </p>

        <p>Logical '1' – a 562.5µs pulse burst followed by a 1.6875ms
        space, with a total transmit time of 2.25ms
        </p>

        <h3>Anatomy of a signal.</h3>

        <p>According to the NEC protocol, a transmission is started with
        a leader code, which is a burst with a length of 9 ms, followed
        by a pause of 4.5 ms and then the data word. Within the data
        word, the address and the data bits are transmitted twice, first
        as a normal byte and immediately after as an inverted byte.
        </p>

        <h3>The build</h3>

        <p>Materials Used</p>
        <ul>
          <li>lens</li>
          <li>IR emitter</li>
          <li>buzzer</li>
          <li>buttons</li>

          <li>resistors</li>
          <li>Arduino Uno Microcontroller</li>
        </ul>

        <p>I wanted to add some feed-back, so the user would know when he
        got hit by another player, and when he fires, so I added a
        buzzer, a muzzle LED, and ‘hit’ LED. As you can see on the
        breadboard, the circuits for these are very simple at this
        point. They are just the output, plus a resistor to control the
        current that flows through the device.
        </p>

        <p>I used an Arduino Uno, since they are fairly cheap, and I can
        use just the chip instead of the whole development board.
        </p>

        <p>The most important aspect of this project is the IR emitter,
        so I want to spend the most amount of time perfecting its
        circuit and making sure I have the largest possible range with
        an adequate to satisfactory battery life. Given the following
        formula:
        </p>

        <figure><img src="assets/blog/transmission.jpg" height="185" width="600"><figcaption><center> "Vishay Semiconductors, General Overview of IR Transmission in Free Ambient"</center><figcaption></figcaption></figcaption></figure>

        <br>

        <p>We see that one possible way to increase the maximum
        transmission range is to increase the emitter intensity, which
        we can increase in two different ways. Either we can focus the
        beam of the IR LED, or we can increase the amount of current,
        and conversely the amount of power going to the LED.
        </p>

        <p>
        We can use a double-convex lens to focus the beam of the emitter.
        Likewise, by the very nature of this project, we will not be
        using the IR emitter for prolonged periods of time, we could
        safely increase the current supplied for very short periods of
        time without causing damage to the LED. We will set up the IR
        emitter to only transmit once per an arbitrary period of time,
        say, once per second. Within this period of one second, the
        beam will only transmit data for a few milliseconds, and that
        data will be sent in pulses as per the NEC protocol. This allows
        the LED to use more power without risk of damage.
        </p>

        <p>
        For the choice of lens, I used several websites and forums to
        find the best size and shape, at the lowest possible cost, while
        maintaining good quality and a reasonable size. Below is one
        that I found particularly useful.
        </p><p>

        </p><p><a href="http://alumnus.caltech.edu/~leif/infratag/lens_choice.html"> Choosing a Lens</a></p>

        <p>
        This is an interesting page that describes different types of lens,
        background information, and focal lengths in the context of IR laser
        tag guns.
        </p>


        <p> Just as important as the hardware, is the software used.
        The IR library that come preloaded with the Arduino seem to
        have some issues with them, so I used the <a href="https://github.com/z3t0/Arduino-IRremote">library</a>
        created by Ken Shirriff. Ken has done some fantastic work,
        and his library is widely used by other laser gun enthusiasts,
        and in various IR communication projects.
        </p>

        <p>To be continued as I work on this project.
